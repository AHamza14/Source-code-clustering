# Source Code Clustering

## Overview

This desktop application is designed to experiment with source code clustering techniques within the context of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). The tool aids in identifying high-level concepts from legacy systems' source code, facilitating their modernization and improving maintainability.

## Features

- **Source code clustering**: Implement various clustering techniques to analyze and group similar source code entities.
- **Metrics**: Calculate internal and external metrics to evaluate clustering effectiveness.
- **Preprocessing scenarios**: Support for three preprocessing scenarios:
  - **WoPP**: Without Preprocessing.
  - **PPwS**: Preprocessing with Stemming.
  - **PPWoS**: Preprocessing Without Stemming.
- **Noisy Dataset Handling**: Evaluate clustering effectiveness on both normal and noisy datasets.
